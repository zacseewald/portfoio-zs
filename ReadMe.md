# Clip Path

### Discription:
This app is a simple example of a text clip-path with a video playing in the background to fill the text with motion.  It's made with an svg tag, a text field and a clip-mask.

Along with the clip-mask, it also shows how to use a gradient as a fill for the mask.

...really cool stuff.
