# Clip Path 
[Site Link](https://zacseewald.github.io/svgSass-animation/)

### Discription:
This app is a simple example of a text clip-path with a video playing in the background to fill the text with motion.  It's made with an svg tag, a text field and a clip-mask.

Along with the clip-mask, it also shows how to use a gradient as a fill for the mask.

...really cool stuff.

### Tech
- HTML
- Sass
- CSS
- JavaScript

### UX/UI
Designed for desktop.

### Purpose
- To further my understaning of svg uses and applying masks for css design.
- Because it's cool, and I can...

### Future
- There are some issues with the animation and display on the iPhone with Safari, so that needs to be worked out...but other than that, I've taken it as far as I plan to go at the moment..
